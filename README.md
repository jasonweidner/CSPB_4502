# Project Title
**Information Gain of Twitter ‘Social Spambots’ and Classification with Random Forest**

# Team Members
Joaquin Quintana & Jason Weidner

# Description:
In this work we aimed to use open source Twitter data, gathered by academic researchers, to calculate information gain for a handful of rules that could separate bots from authentic Twitter users. We also aimed to generate a bot classifier using the Random Forest algorithm, leveraging sklearn. We are particularly interested in doing these calculations on both traditional spambots and newer more sophisticated ‘social spambots.’

# Summary of the questions sought and the answers
These data show that:
- Social spambots really do behave differently than traditional spambots on Twitter
- Sub-classes of social spambots can be unique to other social spambots, too
- Sklearn allows an analyst to generate a classifier very quickly (can be a few lines of code)
- A classifier built with a few rules can identify spambots >90% on Twitter using publicly accessible datasets
